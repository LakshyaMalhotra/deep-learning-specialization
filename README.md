# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

This repository contains all the programming assignments that I completed from [Deep Learning specializaion](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?skipBrowseRedirect=true&skipRecommendationsRedirect=true&tab=completed) taught by Prof. Andrew Ng on coursera.

The specialization contains a series of five courses:

- Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Course 5: Sequence Models

Out of these 5 courses, course 3 does not have any programming assignments. But this course was amazing as it has very interesting quizzes based on case studies.

The programming assignments for the rest of the courses are organized in the order of the weeks they appeared in the actual specialization.
